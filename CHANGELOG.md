# PineTimeSD Change Log

Note that the first figure in the version number (230) is to distinguish this build from 
InfiniTime builds (230 is the ASCII values of OSD added together).
So we only actually use two levels of version numbers for PineTimeSD and ignore the 230.

  - V230.0.1 - first working version
  - V230.0.2 
    - Added allways on dislay from https://github.com/InfiniTimeOrg/InfiniTime/pull/1869
    - Added OSD Watch face to make it clear it is OSD that is running rather than infinitime.
    - Changed BLE Device name to PineTimeSD to distinguish it from stock InfiniTime firmware
    - Starts heart rate sensor automatically on start-up
  - V230.0.3
    - Changed device name back to InfiniTime so that GadgetBridge detects it to update firmware
  - V230.0.4

  - V230.0.5
    - Added fault detection to OSD alarm status.
  - V230.0.6
